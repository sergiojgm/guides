Product Review
==============

Cut down cycle time and focus on the user
by getting a teammate to review your changes to the product
before you get a code review or deploy to staging.

For each change, choose one of four techniques:

* In-person
* Screencast
* Video chat and screenshare

In-person
---------

If they are sitting next to you,
have them review the changes in person.

Screencast
----------

Use [ScreenHero] to share a screencast gif in the project's [Slack] channel.
